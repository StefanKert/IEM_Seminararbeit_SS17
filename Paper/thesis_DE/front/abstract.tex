\chapter{Abstract}
The applications of \textit{Natural Language Processing} nowadays are no longer restricted to language assistants, which enable the user to perform various tasks via speech input. In the last few years, many other areas have been developed. This includes, for example, the classifying of texts or the detection of spam e-mails \cite{DannReconstructing}\cite{Rohit2014}.

Many companies underestimate the application of \textit{Natural Language Processing}. While more and more companies are using the application of \textit{Natural Language Processing} to communicate directly with customers, mostly via so called chat bots, they do not invest in the implementation of further applications.

The main goal of this paper is to analyze further applications of \textit{Natural Language Processing} in the company environment. Using an example process of an IT company, it is shown how \textit{Natural Language Processing} can be integrated, what improvements are expected and an outlook on the feasibility of this integration.
